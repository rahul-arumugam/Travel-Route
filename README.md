# Travel-Route

#PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Your son took a vacation through Europe without telling you. When the kid returned from the vacation you asked him where did he go. The kid told you: Dad I went to these cities: Amsterdam, Kiev, Zurich, Prague, Berlin, Barcelona.I used only train as transportation and these were the available tickets: Paris-Skopje, Zurich-Amsterdam, Prague-Zurich, Barcelona-Berlin, Kiev-Prague, Skopje-Paris, Amsterdam-Barcelona, Berlin-Kiev, Berlin-Amsterdam.(You know that your kid started with Kiev)
*Write a data structure and algorithm that will give you the route which your son was traveling*

THE PROCESS:

By using Graph method the data structure will works this process integrated in javascript because the input gathering and the outputs are shown in web page like frontend connection.So I have utilize the some Reference to make this code run.I have connected all styles and javascript in on html file itself.

STEP-01: Frontend Creation:
Create the HTML structure for your webpage. You'll need input fields for entering the ticket information, a button to trigger the route calculation, and an area to display the result.The code will be in index.html file in this repository.

STEP-02: Connecting CSS style:
STEP-03:Algorithm Integration:

Inside the JavaScript code where it says "Perform the route calculation," you should integrate your route-finding algorithm adapted to JavaScript.This will involve parsing the ticket input, running the algorithm, and displaying the result in the "resultElement."It splits the input tickets into an array and creates a graph data structure to represent the train connections.
It defines a depth-first search function to find the route, and when the route is found, it displays the result in the "routeResult" div.

The above process all in the index.html file.
